# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction with Random Forest

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the forest cover type from cartographic variables. It is based on the Forest CoverType dataset.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/forest-cover-type-prediction/data) and includes features like elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area to classify forest cover types.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Model training using `RandomForestClassifier`
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forest-cover-type-prediction.git
   cd forest-cover-type-prediction
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
